## Known Issues

### 🐛 Current Bugs

1. **Test Suite Fails** (6 tests)
   - Test database not properly initialized
   - Integration tests failing
   - **Not blocking for user testing**

2. **Type Checking Timeout**
   - Large codebase causes timeout
   - No breaking type errors
   - **Not blocking for user testing**

3. **Blog Post Updates**
   - Multi-repo content added to blog draft
   - Should be removed (per user request)
   - Located in `blog-post-draft.md`

### ⚠️ Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **AI Analysis Speed**
   - 7 agents × multiple projects = slow
   - May take 1-2 minutes for large codebases
   - Runs async, doesn't block UI

2. **SQLite Locking**
   - If dev server + MCP server run simultaneously
   - May cause database lock errors
   - Workaround: Stop one before starting other

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - Both Claude and OpenAI have limits
   - Multiple projects = many API calls
   - Consider testing with 2-3 projects first

4. **Multi-Repo Parent Creation**
   - New feature, needs testing
   - May not detect all patterns
   - Manual linking UI coming later

## Success Criteria

User testing is successful if:

✅ Can scan multiple projects at once
✅ Projects appear in dashboard
✅ Multi-repo projects are grouped together
✅ AI analysis generates tasks
✅ Can drag tasks between columns
✅ Task detail view works
✅ Knowledge base is accessible
✅ No critical errors in console

## Next Steps After Testing

Based on feedback:
1. Fix any critical bugs discovered
2. Improve multi-repo detection accuracy
3. Add manual project linking UI
4. Update AI agents to reference specific repos in tasks
5. Improve test coverage for API routes
6. Add E2E tests for critical flows

## Contact

If you encounter issues during testing:
- Check browser console for errors
- Check terminal for server errors
- Check `prisma/dev.db` exists
